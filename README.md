The [Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC)](https://ibcprotocol.dev/) allows blockchains to talk to each other. This end-to-end, connection-oriented, stateful protocol provides reliable, ordered, and authenticated communication between heterogeneous blockchains. 

This IBC implementation in Golang is built as a Cosmos SDK module. To understand more about how to use the `ibc-go` module as well as about the IBC protocol, please check out the Interchain Developer Academy [section on IBC](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/academy/3-ibc/), or [our docs](https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/ibc/overview.html).

## Roadmap

For an overview of upcoming changes to ibc-go take a look at the [roadmap](./docs/roadmap/roadmap.md).

This roadmap is also available as a [project board](https://github.com/orgs/cosmos/projects/7/views/25).

For the latest expected release timelines, please check [here](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/wiki/Release-timeline).

For the latest information on the progress of the work or the decisions made that might influence the roadmap, please follow our [engineering updates](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/wiki/Engineering-updates).

## Releases

The release lines currently supported are v2, v3, v4 and v5. 

Please refer to the [Stable Release Policy section of RELEASES.md](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/main/RELEASES.md#stable-release-policy) for more details.

Please refer to our [versioning guide](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/main/RELEASES.md) for more information on how to understand our release versioning.

## Ecosystem

Discover the applications, middleware and light clients developed by other awesome teams in the ecosystem:

In the table below
`app` refers to IBC application modules for custom use cases and
`middleware` refers to modules that wrap an IBC application enabling custom logic to be executed.


|Description|Repository|Type|
|----------|----------|----|
|An application that enables on chain querying of another IBC enabled chain utilizing `baseapp.Query`. Both chains must have implemented the query application and ICA (for queries requiring consensus).|[ICQ](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/ibc-go/tree/feature/icq_implementation/modules/apps/icq)|`app`|
|An application that enables on chain querying of another IBC enabled chains state without the need for the chain being queried to implement the application.|[interchain-queries](https://github.com/ingenuity-build/interchain-queries)|`app`|
|An application that enables on chain querying of another IBC enabled chains state without the need for the chain being queried to implement the application. Similar to the interchain-queries application in the row above but without callbacks.|[query](https://github.com/defund-labs/defund/tree/main/x/query)|`app`|
|An application that enables cross chain NFT transfer.|[NFT Transfer (ICS 721)](https://github.com/bianjieai/nft-transfer)|`app`|
|Middleware enabling a packet to be sent to a destination chain via an intermediate chain, e.g. going from Juno to Osmosis via the Hub.|[packet-forward-middleware](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware)|`middleware`|
|Middleware enabling the recovery of tokens sent to unsupported addresses.|[recovery](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/tree/main/x/recovery)|`middleware`|
|Middleware that limits the in or out flow of an asset in a certain time period to minimise the risks of cross chain token transfers.|[IBC-rate-limiting](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/pull/2339)|`middleware`|
